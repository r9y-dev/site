Idea to drop malicious scanning traffic using simple header presence.
- Google cloud load balancer allows drop of requests which are missing a required header.
- alternative suggestion: private DNS server with high flux. poses connectivity problems. Rotate DNS when it gets hammered.
- actual customers are also public hospitals and large use cases, so rate limiting is not ok
- still using IPv4
- difficulty finding needle in haystack of noise
- also interested in reducing cost
- bad actor humans require human counter measures
- cloud armor costs $, can we drop traffic beforehand?

raspberry pi 5 desktop experiment
- Joined zoom by phone, still no mic for joining from the pi yet. using an action cam. using NVMe is faster than SSD

How to work with IoT blue/green fleet deployments in a personal mobility context?
- k8s gateway gcp tcp endpoints, load balancer in front.
- hard to split into different pods because TCP connections are ephemeral, thousands of devices, no affinity
- It takes tens of minutes. Can we go faster?
